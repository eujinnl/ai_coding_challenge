# Challenge
1. Please take the provided VoiceLine-snippets and create embeddings
   - use Llama-7b or openAi's ada-002 or similar quality options
2. Cluster those embeddings using some Clustering Algorithm of your choice
3. Present your clusters topicwise in a way that makes sense to you


Use anything u feel comfortable with, we don't expect specific results, its almost only important how you approached it. Stop at a maximumum of 4 hours invested!
If you have any questions, ping us of course.
When you are done, just shoot the code over as a zip or push it to a repo, both ways are totally fine.
